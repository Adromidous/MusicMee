# MusicMee
ALOHA! Welcome to another one of my projects which I created over some of my free time

The app is called _MusicMee_ and the reason I created it was due to the fact that I got tired of listening to the same songs over and over again... (A problem that I believe many music listeners go through :P)

Although this full-stack application is still under development, I thought it would be a good idea to show what I have so far so that I can always come back and improve the application in any way possible.

**_______TECH STACK:_______**  

**BACKEND:** Express.js, Node.js  
**FRONTEND:** Javascript, React.js  
**DATABASE:** MongoDB  

Just a reminder that this application isn't fully up to date yet and there are many improvements I'm still trying to make before I put this application on the cloud. If you see some sort of \<Insert key here\>, \<Insert password here\>, etc, you'll have to put in your own account details.

I've included some pictures of the application below:
